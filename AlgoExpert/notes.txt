Network Protocols:
    - Internet Protocol
        - All information stored in bytes
        - Header:
            - Anywhere between 20 and 60 Bytes
            - Source IP Adress
            - Destination IP Adress
            - Total Size of the Packet
            - Version of the Internet Protocol (4 or 6)
        - Data:
            - Information that one machine is sending to another
            - One IP data can send a max 2^16 bytes or 0.65 MB
            - Hence multiple IP packets are used to send large data 
    - Transmission Control Protocol:
        - Built on top of the Internet Protocol
        - Meant to send IP packets in an ordered way
        - Reliable that all packets will be received
        - Allows to send arbitrarily long pieces of data to other machines
        - Apart from the conventional header, TCP also contains TCP Header
        - Header:
        - TCP Header:
        - Data: 
        - A TCP connection is setup with source and destination servers through handshake
    - HyperText Transfer Protocol:
        - Protocol that is built on top of TCP 
        - Introduce a higher level abstraction above TCP and IP
        - With HTTP, we completely forget about IP packets, we forget about TCP
        - All that we care about are HTTP requests and responses
        - HTTP Requests consists of the following schema:
            - host
            - port
            - method
            - headers
            - body
        - HTTP Response consists of the following schema:
            - status code
            - headers
            - body
