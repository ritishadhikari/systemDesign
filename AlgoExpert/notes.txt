Design Fundamentals:    
    - Foundations Systems Design Knowledge
    - Key Characteristics of Systems
    - Actual Components of the Systems
    - Actual Tech

Network Protocols:
    - Internet Protocol
        - All information stored in bytes
        - Header:
            - Anywhere between 20 and 60 Bytes
            - Source IP Adress
            - Destination IP Adress
            - Total Size of the Packet
            - Version of the Internet Protocol (4 or 6)
        - Data:
            - Information that one machine is sending to another
            - One IP data can send a max 2^16 bytes or 0.65 MB
            - Hence multiple IP packets are used to send large data 
    - Transmission Control Protocol:
        - Built on top of the Internet Protocol
        - Meant to send IP packets in an ordered way
        - Reliable that all packets will be received
        - Allows to send arbitrarily long pieces of data to other machines
        - Apart from the conventional header, TCP also contains TCP Header
        - Header:
        - TCP Header:
        - Data: 
        - A TCP connection is setup with source and destination servers through handshake
    - HyperText Transfer Protocol:
        - Protocol that is built on top of TCP 
        - Introduce a higher level abstraction above TCP and IP
        - With HTTP, we completely forget about IP packets, we forget about TCP
        - All that we care about are HTTP requests and responses
        - HTTP Requests consists of the following schema:
            - host
            - port
            - method
            - headers
            - body
        - HTTP Response consists of the following schema:
            - status code
            - headers
            - body

Key Value Store:
    - Useful for caching
    - Lowered Latencies and Improved Throughputs
    - Some Key Value Stores data into disk while others might write data into memory

Specialized Storage Paradigm:
    - Blob Store:
        - Binary Large Object
        - Any Arbitrary piece of unstructured data is a Blob
        - GCS/S3/Azure Blobe Storage
        - Behave like key value store
    - Time Series Database:
        - Data which are all related to data
        - Used for Monitoring, IOT, Stock Prices, etc
        - Influx DB and Prometheus
    - Graph Database:
        - Built on top of the Graph Data Model
        - Neo4J
        - Useful in Social Networks Facebooks, Youtube, etc
    - Spatial Database:
        - Locations on a Map
        - Google Maps
        - Quadtree has either 0 children nodes or no children nodes (leaf)
        - Specialized Databases for Spatial data or Mongo/PostGres can be deemed fit
