Is it a build only system or a Build and Test System?

Assume the testing is already covered, but Build it on a global scale.

When is the code build and deploy going to happen? 

Assume when the push is going to happen in a master branch, then automatically build and deploy
is going to happen.

Code needs to be deployed globally, with machines spread across 5-10 regions globally with 100s of 
machines deployed across those regions

All build must be deployed within 30 minutes and the availability must have 2-3 nines, i.e., downtime
of 2-3 days in Total

Deployment is like that of in a large company, where deployment will be done thousands of times in a day

Build size per build can reach upto 10GBs

Separating the two processes:
        - Building Code:   
            - Build will be in the form of a Queue
            - The First Commit will be the first to be deployed
            - The binary will be built on the workers
            - Once the Binary is built, it is stored in storage like a Blob Storage, ex. GCS.
            - The Queues of commits will be processed in pool of servers which would run those jobs
            - The output of those jobs in the form of binary will be stored in GCS bucket
            - The job details will be stored in SQL table which will be used to deque the next job 
            - The fields in the job table should be: 
                - id
                - name of the binary which will be referenced to a GCS bucket
                - time of creation of the job
                - time of merger with the master branch (SHA)
                - status of build : Succeed or Failed
            - The choice of SQL is because, it will uphold the acid properties and the distributed
            workers will be able to select the right job as per time of creation thereby maintaning
            concurrencies
            - BEGIN TRANSACTION; SELECT * FROM JOBS WHERE STATUS = "QUEUED" ORDER BY CREATED_AT
             ASC LIMIT 1; UPDATE jobs SET STATUS = "RUNNING" WHERE CREATED_AT IN (SELECT MIN(CREATE_AT) 
             FROM jobs WHERE STATUS ="QUEUED")
        - Deploying Code:
