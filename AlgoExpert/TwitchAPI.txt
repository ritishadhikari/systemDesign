- live chat (handle emotes)
- live stream video with video info
- concurrent viewers (update every 30 seconds)
- recommended channels

For this interview we are designing all of this, except for the recommended channels

If a user wants to follow a particular channel, then automatically that button should get
switched from follow to unfollow in real time. Same for subscribe to unsubscribe.

For the live chats, we do want to have twitch emotes but we don't have to worry about emotes
which are applicable for select subscribers or purchasable emotes.

Also we should handle banning of users in chats who are trying to spam the chats.

When ever an user tries to access any service, the user's token will be passed by default.
