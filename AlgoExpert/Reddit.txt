Design an API of a Subreddit.

Subreddit is an online community where users can write posts, they can comment on posts, vote on posts,
they can become moderators, etc. 

Sticking to writing posts, writing comment, upvoting and downvoting.

Need to create the API details for the above functionalities.

UserID and SubredditID will be contained 

The two most Important Functionalities:
    - Post
        - Schema:
            - postID: String (generated on the server side)
            - creatorID: string

            - createdAt: timestamp
            - votesCounts: Integer
            - commentsCounts: Integer
        - Create API
            - userID: string (at the backend it becomes creator id)
            - subRedditID: string
            - title: string
            - desc: string (description of the post)
            - Return the entity as the response, i.e. Post
        - Get API:
            - postID: string
            - userID: string
            - Return the entity as the response, i.e. Post
        - Edit
            - userID: string
            - postID: string
            - title: string
            - desc: string

        - Delete
            - postID: string
            - userID: string (the user ID will be validated by a separate ACL service) 
            - Return the entity as the response, i.e. Post
        - List 
            - Needs to be paginated
            - userID: string
            - subReddit: string
            - pageSize(optional parameter pre-defined by a default value)
            - pageToken: integer (Reference to know where to start from)
            - Returns a List of Post, next page token - Integer

    - Comment:
        - CommentID: string
        - creatorID: string
        - postID: string
        - createdAt: timestamp
        - votesCount: integer 
        - content: string

        - the reply option will be bounded by the commentID and the UI should sort the reply based on the 
        timeStamp when it was created.
