Scalability: It is the capability of a system, process or network to grow and manage increased demand. 
Any distributed system that can continously evolve to support the growing growing amount of work is considered
scalable.

Horizontal Scaling: It means that you scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources. Ex: Cassandra
and MongoDB

Vertical Scaling: vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc). Ex: MySQL

Reliability: A distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or 
several of its software or hardware components fails. A distributed system achieves reliability through the
reducndancy of both the software components and data.

Availability: Availability is when a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific
period. If a system is reliable, then it is available. However, if it is available, it is not necessarily 
reliable.

Two Standard measures of efficiency are:
    - Response Time (latency): Denotes the delay to obtain the first item.
    - Throughput (Bandwidth): Number of items delivered in a given unit (eg. a second) 

Serviceability or Manageability:  It is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or
maintained. Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime.
